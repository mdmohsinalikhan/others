\documentclass[journal]{IEEEtran}
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[journal]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we have presented an algorithmic design methodology for designing integrated millimeter-wave quadrature coupler based on slow-wave coupled line. The design methodology is verified by a 3-dB quadrature coupler in a commercially available CMOS technology. The designed CMOS coupler covers the whole E- to W-band and occupies only 0.0115 mm$^2$  silicon area. The consumed wafer area is 50\% smaller compared to the conventional microstrip line based couplers. Measurement of the slow-wave 90$^\circ$ coupler shows a -3.5 dB through and -4.4 dB coupling at 90 GHz, and less than $\pm$1-dB amplitude and $\pm$4$^\circ$ phase errors from 55 to 110 GHz.

\IEEEPARstart{C}{ommunication} at millimeter-wave frequencies has drawn a lot of consideration due to the availability of wide fractional bandwidths and small antenna sizes. Recently, there has been increasing research and commercial development of integrated circuits for wireless communication at E- and W-band and automotive radar application at 77 GHz. Commercially available silicon technologies show potentiality to realize cost-effective, highly integrated systems for these applications []-[]. Like in microwave design techniques, silicon IC designs at millimeter-wave frequencies also include transmission lines, splitters, combiners, baluns, and couplers [Floyd1], [Niknijad], [Mikko.RMixer]. Among these passive circuit elements, 3-dB coupler having 90$^\circ$ phase difference between the outputs is a very important building block. It can be used for I/Q modulator-demodulator [ISSCC.shimawaki], phase shifters [IBM.60G], triplers [Northop.tripler], and various mixer topologies [D.MWCL], [Rebeiz.mixer]. These couplers are usually realized by the design technique called Lange coupler, invented by J. Lange [MKK.6]. The Lange couplers are popular due to its broadband and accurate quadrature performance. The coupler design techniques involve quarter wavelength lines at the design frequency and are usually realized with microstrip lines. One major drawback to microstrip lines on the standard silicon technologies is the low effective dielectric constant ($\sim$4) which is defined by the surrounding media (silicon dioxide). Therefore, the sizes of the couplers become very large. 

Efforts have been given to miniaturize the size of silicon quadrature couplers [Floyd.IMS], [EuMIC.Ferrari]. In [Floyd.IMS], thin film microstip line was used to achieve the required coupling coefficient and an aggressive meandering was implemented to reduce the size of the coupler. In [EuMIC.Ferrari], coupler based on coupled slow-wave coplanar waveguide (CS-CPW) was presented and required coupling was achieved by modifying the shielding ribbons. However, the work has considered BiCMOS technology which allowed the designers to use wider lines compared with a standard CMOS technology. Furthermore, none of the works did address the modeling methodology used for designing their proposed complex structures. 

In this work, an algorithmic design technique for a compact mm-wave coupler is presented which is feasible for any silicon technology. The coupler design is based on the use of CS-CPW and approaches a complete new way to miniaturize the structure. The proposed structure is easy to model and scalable in length. The structure provides required coupling by placing metal slabs on coupled lines within the CS-CPW structure. Since the coupler structure is based on CS-CPW structure, the modeling of the coupler relies on the fast and reliable modeling technique proposed in [Dristy.EuMIC]. Furthermore, the behavior of a CS-CPW is analyzed and based on the analysis; a conclusion of defining a good initial value of the design parameters for the EM simulation is drawn. For a proof-of-concept, a 3-dB quadrature coupler was designed. The coupler exhibits excellent performance over the entire E- to W-band.   

The paper is organized as follows. Section II describes briefly the modeling methodology of the CS-CPWs. A study on the behavior of CS-CPW is covered in section III. A mathematical model is derived in section IV from the behavior analysis to estimate the initial design parameters for the EM simulation. An algorithmic design of the coupler based on CS-CPW is presented in section V. Section VI includes the design detail of the 3-dB quadrature coupler. Measurement results are presented in section VII.

\section{Modeling of the Coupled Slow-wave Co-planar Waveguide}

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{CS-CPW_basic.png}
	\caption{3-D view of a coupled slow-wave coplanar waveguide (CS-CPW).}
	\label{basic_CS_CPW}
\end{figure}

A coupled slow-wave co-planar waveguide (CS-CPW) is an efficient way of implementing a coupled line in silicon technology. The CS-CPW are basically the modified versions of slow-wave co-planar waveguides (S-CPWs) which are popular for their compactness [J.Long], [Ferrari2]. 3-D view of a fundamental CS-CPW is illustrated in Fig. \ref{basic_CS_CPW}. The CS-CPW structures are composed of two signal lines of widths \textit{W} separated by a gap \textit{S}, two side-ground lines with widths of \textit{GW} located in a distance of \textit{SG} from the signal lines, and slotted metal strips below the signal lines at a distance of \textit{D}. Simulation of the complete CS-CPW structure as in Fig. \ref{basic_CS_CPW} is computationally heavy and time-consuming. Therefore, an efficient modeling methodology for designing the CS-CPW is proposed in [D.EuMIC] and successfully verified in [D. TMTT]. In the modeling approach, the side-ground lines serve as well-defined ground return current paths for the even-mode signal propagation and divides the EM problem into four parts [D.EuMIC]. 
The EM problem is first divided into odd- and even-mode analysis and each mode is further decoupled into odd- and even-mode \textit{R \& L} and \textit{C \& G} analysis. Here the \textit{R, L, C,} and \textit{G} are the typical transmission line parameters (Telegrapher’s equation) [Pozar] which support the transverse electromagnetic (TEM) propagation. A graphical representation of the modeling method is illustrated in Fig. \ref{modeling_method}. The port definitions for the EM simulations of the odd- and even-mode analysis are also included in the Fig. \ref{modeling_method}. Four two-port \textit{S}-parameter data sets are obtained from these four EM simulations. Using these data sets, the odd- and even-mode \textit{R, L, C,} and \textit{G} parameters are calculated by the formulas stated in [Einstad]. Once the \textit{R, L, C,} and \textit{G} parameters for both the modes are obtained, the other essential transmission line parameters can be calculated from [Pozar]. The necessary model parameters for a coupled transmission line are odd- and even-mode characteristic impedances (\textit{Z$_{0o}$}, \textit{Z$_{0e}$}), effective dielectric constants ($\varepsilon$$_{ro}$, $\varepsilon$$_{re}$), attenuation constants ($\alpha$$_o$, $\alpha$$_e$), and loss tangent (tan$\delta$). To design a scalable (in length) electrical model of the CS-CPW, a physical coupled line model (CLINP) supported by the simulator Keysight's ADS [ADS] is used. A first-order frequency-dependent loss model is considered in the line model.

\section{Behavior Analysis of Coupled Slow-wave Co-planar Waveguides}

In this section, we have analyzed the electrical behavior of the CS-CPW structure by EM
simulations. We have studied the structure, mainly to derive a table showing the behavior of the structure at different geometric parameters. This table will help the designers to select the suitable initial values of the geometric parameters for the EM simulations in order to obtain a given design goal. Furthermore, the table will also be useful for the optimization iterations of the design. 
For this study, we had varied the geometric parameters \textit{S, D, W, SG, GW} and observed the changes in odd- and even-mode inductances (\textit{L$_{odd}$}, \textit{L$_{even}$}), capacitances (\textit{C$_{odd}$}, \textit{C$_{even}$}), and impedances (\textit{Z$_{0o}$}, \textit{Z$_{0e}$}). While varying one parameter, the other parameters were kept constant. A commercially available standard 65-nm CMOS technology was used and we have considered a length of 110 $\mu$m of CS-CPW for this analysis. The EM simulations were performed based on the modeling methodology described in the previous section. A generic cross-sectional view of the CMOS technology applied in this study is shown in Fig. \ref{tech_cross}.

At first we had created a CS-CPW structure with the arbitrary design variables and use its fundamental structure as shown in Fig. \ref{basic_CS_CPW} and simulated in a 2.5D EM simulator. Apart from the fundamental structure, we had also analyzed another structure where two metal layers were electrically connected with vias for the signal lines as shown in Fig. \ref{tech_cross}. The modified structure gave lower inductances and capacitances per unit length. The changes in \textit{L$_{odd}$}, \textit{L$_{even}$}, \textit{C$_{odd}$}, \textit{C$_{even}$}, \textit{Z$_{0o}$}, and \textit{Z$_{0e}$} for different geometric parameters of the CS-CPW are shown in Fig. \ref{behavior}. These variations are tabulated in Table \ref{table:mapping} with the indicators showing increasing ($\uparrow$), decreasing ($\downarrow$), and no changing ($\updownarrow$) states over the changes in geometric parameters.

This behavior analysis gives a reasonable first approximation of selecting the design variables for the EM simulation. For an example, consider a case where we want to obtain a ratio of 1:6 for the odd- and even-mode impedances. It is evident from Fig. \ref{behavior} and Table \ref{table:mapping} that all the geometric parameters except the \textit{SG} and \textit{GW} have the influence on both the odd- and even-mode impedances. Therefore, for an initial guess to obtain such a large ratio, we must choose a minimum possible gap \textit{S} between the signal lines. Moderate values can be chosen for the \textit{W} and \textit{D} and since the even-mode return current paths are defined to the side-ground lines, the even-mode impedances can be controlled by varying the \textit{SG} and \textit{GW} without affecting the odd-mode impedances. This property of CS-CPW gives a great design flexibility.

Alternatively, instead of speculating the initial design variables from the behavior of the structure, one can obtain a mathematical model of the behavior of the structure using the simulation data. Then optimize the mathematical model to find the initial design variables. In the following section, we do linear regression to find a linear model and linear programming to optimize the linear model. We take the output of the linear program as the values of the initial design varibles.

\section{Mathematical Model for Estimating the Design Parameters}
For the sake of simplicity, let us change the variable notations from \textit{W, S, D, GW}, and \textit{SG} to $x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4$, and $x_5$ respectively. The two critical positive outputs \textit{Z$_{0e}$} and \textit{Z$_{0o}$} to   $y_1,y_2 \in \mathbb{R}$. We have learnt that $y_1$ is a function on $5$ positive variables $x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,x_5 \in \mathbb{R}$ and we name this function $F$. We also have learnt that $y_2$ is a function on $3$ variables $x_1,x_2,x_3$ and we name this function $G$. Apart from being positive and real, the input variables have some other constrains depending on the used technology. We are interested to optimize the functions $F$ and $G$ while satisfying all the technology dependant contstraints. We have been interested to optimize these functions in few alternative ways. The candidates are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Maximize $F - G$: Finding values $x_1=a_1$, $x_2=a_2$, $x_3=a_3$, $x_4=a_4$, $x_5=a_5$ so that $F(a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_5) - G(a_1,a_2,a_3)$ becomes as small as possible.
	\item Minimize $\vert\frac{F}{G}-b\vert$: Finding values $x_1=a_1$, $x_2=a_2$, $x_3=a_3$, $x_4=a_4$, $x_5=a_5$ so that $\frac{F(a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_5)}{G(a_1,a_2,a_3)}$ becomes as close as possible to a certain constant $b$ (ratio of)
	\item Minimize $\vert F-b_1 \vert + \vert G-b_2 \vert$: Finding values $x_1=a_1$, $x_2=a_2$, $x_3=a_3$, $x_4=a_4$, $x_5=a_5$ so that $F(a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_5)$ and $G(a_1,a_2,a_3)$  goes as close as possible to constant values $b_1$ and $b_2$ respectively.
\end{enumerate}

We need a mathematical model of the functions $F$ and $G$ to do such optimizations. Let $f_i:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be a function that takes the variable $x$ as input while the other input variables $x_{j} \text{ for } j \in \left\lbrace1,...5\right\rbrace\setminus{i}$ of $F$ are kept at constant values i.e., 
\begin{eqnarray}
	f_i(x\vert a_1,...,a_{i-1},x,a_{i+1},...,a_{5}) &=& \nonumber \\ 
	F(a_1,...,a_{i-1},x,a_{i+1},...,a_{5})
\end{eqnarray}
We define the function $g_i:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ in the same way so that 
\begin{eqnarray}
	g_i(x\vert a_1,...,a_{i-1},x,a_{i+1},...,a_{5}) &=& \nonumber \\
	G(a_1,...,a_{i-1},x,a_{i+1},...,a_{5})
\end{eqnarray} 

From the result of the experiments, presented in Figure \ref{behavior}, it is evident that $f_i$ and  $g_i$ are almost, if not exactly, linear functions. Motivated by this observation, we make an educated guess that both of the functions $F$ and $G$ are approximately linear. We do not provide an analytical argument to justify the linearity of \textit{Z$_{0o}$} and \textit{Z$_{0e}$}. Instead, we use linear regression on the $18$ experimental results to find models $f:\mathbb{R}^5 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, $g:\mathbb{R}^3 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ where $f(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,x_5) \approx G(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,x_5)$ and $g(x_1,x_2,x_3) \approx G(x_1,x_2,x_3)$ and compute the training errors.

\subsection{Linear Regression}
We use linear regression on the $18$ experimental results and find the linear models $f$ and $g$. We have used the statistical programming tool R to do the linear regression. We obtain the following models $f$ and $g$ and their errors by running the source file \textsf{model.R}. The source file is added in the Appendix.

\begin{small}
	\begin{eqnarray}
		f(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5) &=& \nonumber \\ 
		& &-7.266 \cdot x_1 + 0.372 \cdot x_2 + 29.175 \cdot x_3 \nonumber \\
		& &- 3.278 \cdot x_4 + 1.823 \cdot x_5 + 78.226 \\
		g(x_1, x_2, x_3) &=& -5.477 \cdot x_1 + 4.640 \cdot x_2  \nonumber \\
		& & + 4.290 \cdot x_3 + 24.343
	\end{eqnarray}
\end{small}

For an input $(x_1 = a_1,x_2 = a_2,x_3 = a_3,x_4 = a_4,x_5 = a_5)$, the error percentages of the models $f$ and $g$ are as follow

	\begin{eqnarray*}
		& & \frac{|f(a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_5)-F(a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_5)|}{F(a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_5)} \times 100\\
		& & \frac{|g(a_1,a_2,a_3)-G(a_1,a_2,a_3)|}{G(a_1,a_2,a_3)}\times 100
	\end{eqnarray*}

We compute the mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum error percentages of the models $f$ and $g$ over all the $18$ inputs and present in Table \ref{table:error_of_linear_models}.
\begin{table}	
	\caption{Errors of linear models}
	\label{table:error_of_linear_models}
	\begin{tabular}{ | l | l | l | l | l |}
		\hline 
		& &\multicolumn{3}{ c| }{Error percentage} \\
		\hline
		Model & Mean & Standard Deviation & Min  & Max\\ \hline
		$f$ & 2.209766 & 2.480924 & 0.5398369 & 9.525519 \\ \hline
		$g$ & 1.002286 & 1.329765 & 0.008706377 & 5.115356 \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}
We reckon, these error percentages indicate that the underlying functions $F$ and $G$ are fairly linear and the obtained models $f$ and $g$ are fairly good linear approximations. We optimize $F$ and $G$ by optimzing $f$ and $g$ respectively. As $F$ and $G$ are not not exactly linear and our obtained models $f$ and $g$ are linear approximations, the optimal values obtained from the models $f$ and $g$ will have some errors comparing to the optimal values of $F$ and $G$. We expect these errors to be similar to the errors of the models.

\subsection{Optimzing the Linear model Using Linear Programming:}
As both $f$ and $g$ are linear and all the inputs of both of the functions are positive, the optimization problems are most likely to be representable as a linear programming problem. The linear programming problem would involve $5$ variables. A linear programming problem with $5$ variables is a small instance of a linear programming problem. There exist efficient algorithms, namely, simplex, ellipsoid, etc. for solving linear programming problems. In practice, a linear programming problem can easily be solved by any standard linear programming solver like lp\_solve. Now we present the optimization problems discussed earlier as linear programming problems in the following subsections:

Maximize $f - g$:
We need to find values $x_1 = a_1,x_2 = a_2,x_3 = a_3,x_4 = a_4,x_5 = a_5$ so that $f(a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_5)$ becomes as large as possible while making $g(a_1,a_2,a_3)$ as small as possible, i.e., we need to maximize
	\begin{eqnarray}
		& &f(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,x_5) - g(x_1,x_2,x_3) = -1.7897 \cdot x_1 \nonumber \\
		& & - 3.9176 \cdot x_2 + 24.8859 \cdot x_3 - 3.2784 \cdot x_4  \nonumber \\
		& & + 1.8231 \cdot x_5 + 53.8834
	\end{eqnarray}
Consequently the linear programming problem looks as follows
	\begin{eqnarray*}
		\text{max:} & & -1.7897 \cdot x_1 - 3.9176 \cdot x_2 + 24.8859 \cdot x_3 \nonumber \\
		& &- 3.2784 \cdot x_4 + 1.8231 \cdot x_5 + 53.8834; \nonumber \\
		& & x_1 <= 11; x_2 <= 6; x_3 <= 2.04; \nonumber \\
		& & x_4 <= 11; x_5 <= 20; x_1 >= 2.5; \nonumber \\
		& & x_2 >= 1.5; x_3 >= 1.25;  x_4 >= 4; \nonumber \\
		& & x_5 >= 10; \nonumber\\
	\end{eqnarray*}
The above linear programming problem can be solved by saving the above problem in a file named \textsf{model.lp} (the file is attached) and run the command \textsf{lp\_solve model.lp} from the shell of an unix or unix like operating system. Here is the output:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item We get the maximum value of the objective function to be: $117.648$
	\item The required values of the variables are $x_1 = 2.5,x_2 = 1.5,x_3 = 2.04, x_4 = 4, x_5 = 20$
\end{enumerate}
Feeding this input to $f$ and $g$ we find
	\begin{eqnarray*}
		f(2.5, 1.5, 2.04, 4,20) &=& 143.4855\\
		g(2.5, 1.5, 2.04) &=& 26.3621
	\end{eqnarray*}

We can find the value of $F(2.5, 1.5, 2.04, 4,20)$ and $G(2.5, 1.5, 2.04)$ by running a simulation to see how good the optimization is.


Minimize $\vert\frac{f}{g}-b\vert$: We need to find the values $x_1 = a_1$, $x_2 = a_2$, $x_3 = a_3$, $x_4 = a_4$, $x_5 = a_5$ so that $\frac{f(a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_5)}{g(a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_5)}$ becomes as close as possible to a certain constant $b$. Let us set $b=6$. Then we need to minimize $\frac{f(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,x_5)}{g(x_1,x_2,x_3)}-6$. In other words we need to minimize 
	\begin{eqnarray*}
		& & \vert f(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,x_5) - 6 g(x_1,x_2,x_3) \vert\\
		&=& \vert 25.5953 \cdot x_1 - 27.4675 \cdot x_2 + 3.4358 \cdot x_3 - \nonumber \\
		& & 3.2784 \cdot x_4 + 1.8231 \cdot x_5 - 67.8316 \vert
	\end{eqnarray*}

The above simplification can be done easily for a different value of $b$ than $6$. However, for $b=6$, the linear programming problem looks as follows. Note that a guest variable $X$ has been imported in the linear program because the objective function involves an absolute value.
	\begin{eqnarray*}
		& & \text{min: } X;\\
		& & x_1 <= 11; x_2 <= 6; x_3 <= 2.04; \\
		& & x_4 <= 11; x_5 <= 20; x_1 <= 2.5; \\
		& & x_2 <= 1.5; x_3 <= 1.25; x_4 <= 4; \\
		& & x_5 <= 10; \\
		& & 25.5953 x_1 -  27.4675 x_2 + 3.4358 x_3 \\
		& & - 3.2784 x_4 + 1.8231 x_5 - 67.8316 <= X; \\
		& & -25.5953 x_1 +  27.4675 x_2 - 3.4358 x_3 + \\
		& & 3.2784 x_4 - 1.8231 x_5 + 67.8316 <= X; \\
	\end{eqnarray*}
Here is the output of the linear program:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item We get the maximum value of the objective function to be: $0$
	\item The required values of the variables are $x_1 = 3.89215,x_2 = 1.5,x_3 = 1.25, x_4 = 4, x_5 = 10$
\end{enumerate}

Feeding this input to $f$ and $g$ we find 
	\begin{eqnarray*}
		f(3.89215, 1.5, 1.25, 4,10) &=& 92.08919\\
		g(3.89215, 1.5, 1.25) &=& 15.34819
	\end{eqnarray*}
We can find the value of $F(3.89215, 1.5, 1.25, 4,10)$ and $G(3.89215, 1.5, 1.25)$ by running a simulation to see how good the optimization is.

Minimize $\vert f-d_1 \vert + \vert g-d_2 \vert$: Finding the values $x_1 = a_1,x_2 = a_2,x_3 = a_3,x_4 = a_4,x_5 = a_5$ so that $f(a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_5)$ and $g(a_1,a_2,a_3)$  goes as close as possible to constant values $b_1$ and $b_2$ respectively. Let us set $b_1 = 121$ and $b_2 = 20.7$. We need to minimize
	\begin{eqnarray*}
		& &\vert f(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,x_5)-121 \vert + \vert g(x_1,x_2,x_3)-20.7 \vert \\ 
		& = &  \vert -7.2667 \cdot x_1 + 0.3724 \cdot x_2 + 29.1759 \cdot x_3 \\
		& &  - 3.2784 \cdot x_4 + 1.8231 \cdot x_5 - 42.7736 \vert \\
		& & + \vert -5.477 \cdot x_1 + 4.640 \cdot x_2 + 4.290 \cdot x_3 + 3.643 \vert
	\end{eqnarray*}
The above simplification can be done easily for a different value of $b_1$ and $b_2$. However, for $b_1=121$ and $b_2 = 20.7$, the linear programming problem looks as follows. Note that two guest variables $X,Y$ has been imported in the linear program because the objective function involves absolute value.
	\begin{eqnarray*}
		& & \text{min: } X + Y;\\
		& & x_1 <= 11; x_2 <= 6; x_3 <= 2.04; x_4 <= 11; x_5 <= 20; \\
		& & x_1 >= 2.5; x_2 >= 1.5; 	x_3 >= 1.25; x_4 >= 4; x_5 >= 10;\\
		& & -7.2667 x_1 + 0.3724 x_2 + 29.1759 x_3 \\
		& & - 3.2784 x_4 + 1.8231 x_5 - 42.7736 <= X;\\
		& & 7.2667 x_1 - 0.3724 x_2 - 29.1759 x_3 \\
		& & + 3.2784 x_4 - 1.8231 x_5 + 42.7736 <= X;\\
		& & -5.477 x_1 + 4.640 x_2 + 4.290 x_3 + 3.643 <= Y;\\
		& & 5.477 x_1 - 4.640 x_2 - 4.290 x_3 - 3.643 <= Y;\\
	\end{eqnarray*}
Here is the output of the linear program:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item We get the maximum value of the objective function to be: $0$
	\item The required values of the variables are $x_1 = 3.5338,x_2 = 1.5,x_3 = 2.04, x_4 = 4, x_5 = 11.787$
\end{enumerate}
Feeding this input to $f$ and $g$ we find
	\begin{eqnarray*}
		f(3.2077, 1, 1.25, 2.16454, 5) &=& 121.0001\\
		g(3.2077, 1, 1.25) &=& 20.69998
	\end{eqnarray*}
We can find the value of $F(3.2077, 1, 1.25, 2.16454, 5)$ and $G(3.2077, 1, 1.25)$ by running an simulation to see how good the optimization is.

\subsection{Evaluation:}
The underlying functions $F$ and $G$ of the experiments are found to be fairly linear. Keeping this observation in mind, linear approximation $f$ and $g$ can be obtained by linear regression by using only $5$ experimental values. Because $5$ points in a $5$ dimensional space completely defines a $4$ dimensional hyperplane. So, the linear approximations $f$ and $g$ can be easily obtained. Using the linear approximations, the above method can be used to find the values of the variables $x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,x_5$ i.e., \textit{W, S, D, GW, SG} to obtain the desired values of $y_1$ and $y_2$ i.e., \textit{Z$_{0o}$} and \textit{Z$_{0e}$}. 



\section{Algorithmic Design of the Couplers Using CS-CPW}

In this section, we have described a step-by-step procedure to design a coupler using CS-CPW structure. 

\textit{Step 1):} At first, it is important to set the design goal. Depending on the coupler types, i.e. directional coupler with a certain coupling factor or 3-dB quadrature coupler the odd- and even-mode characteristic impedances are the key design parameters to be obtained. Fig. \ref{bcoupler} shows a typical coupled-line coupler with its ports definition. It has been shown in the literature that the maximum coupling between the input port and the coupled port occurs at a frequency, when the lengths of the two identical parallel lines are quarter wavelengths at that frequency [R.Mongia]. Standard mathematical equations to calculate the required odd- and even-mode characteristic impedances for the coupled-line coupler are derived in [R. Mongia] shown in Eq. 1 and 2. Alternatively, an ideal coupled line model from the microwave circuit simulator Keysight's ADS [ADS] or AWR Microwave Office [MWO] can be used to simulate the required odd- and even-mode impedances.

\begin{equation}
Z_{0e}=Z_0 \sqrt{\frac{1+k}{1-k}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
Z_{0o}=Z_0 \sqrt{\frac{1-k}{1+k}}
\end{equation}


\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{general_coupler.png}
	\caption{Typical coupled-line coupler with its ports definition.}
	\label{bcoupler}
\end{figure}


\textit{Step 2):} Once the design goal is determined, we have to make an initial guess of the geometric parameters for the EM simulation. A suitable initial guess of these parameters is critical since it will directly affect the total time required for the design task. As stated in the previous section that the behavior of the CS-CPW shown in Table \ref{table:mapping} or the mathematical modeling approach described in the previous section can be used to predict the initial values of the geometric parameters.

\textit{Step 3):} An efficient EM simulation methodology is important to simulate the CS-CPW structure as the structure has five design variables. As a result, a high number of iterations may require to achieve the given design goal. Therefore, the modeling methodology of CS-CPW structure explained in the section II is proposed for designing the couplers. Since the structure has been modeled using the transmission line parameters [Pozar], the proposed CS-CPW model is scalable in terms of the length. Hence for designing a quadrature coupler, we do not need to simulate at the quarter wavelength of the line but a fractional length of the line. This will further reduce the simulation time. On the other hand, it is also important to check the complete coupler performances, i.e. through, coupling, isolation, and directivity at the quarter wavelength of the line. However, if we simulate the quarter wavelength of the line, we will not be able to extract the reliable line parameters due to the resonance effect. Therefore, the scalable line parameters obtained from the EM simulations are inserted to a built-in physical coupled line model (CLINP) from the microwave circuit simulator ADS [ADS] for the complete coupler simulations. 

\textit{Step 4):} For this CS-CPW based coupler design approach, few iterations may require to obtain the given design goal although the behavior table will help significantly to reduce the number of iterations. If the design goal is not achievable with the fundamental structure of the CS-CPW even after few iterations then the structure can be modified based on the requirement. For an instance, in our design example (described in the next section) we have increased the coupling by modifying the signal lines of the CS-CPW for obtaining an aggressive odd-mode slow-wave effect.

\textit{Step 5):} Finally, depending on the coupler applications, the signal lines can be folded in a similar fashion as in the Lange coupler to place the outputs or inputs on the same side. To finish the design, a complete coupler needs to be drawn in agreement with the design rules for the selected silicon technology. A flow-chart is shown in Fig. \ref{flow_chart} to depict the design flow.

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{flow_chart2.png}
	\caption{Design flow of the couplers using CS-CPW.}

\end{figure}


\section{E- to W-band coupler design example}
The proposed algorithm for designing CS-CPW based coupler was the basis of this design example. The design example had considered a 3-dB quadrature coupler which covers the entire E- and W-band. For a 3-dB quadrature coupler, the voltage coupling coefficient, \textit{k} is calculated to be 0.708. Hence, by using the Eq. 1 and 2, the odd- and even-mode impedances become Z$_{0o}$ = 20.67 $\Omega$, and Z$_{0e}$ = 120.9 $\Omega$ for a 50 $\Omega$ system. As mentioned in the design algorithm, the initial design parameters for the EM simulations can be estimated from the Table \ref{table:mapping} or the mathematical model. In this work, we had experimented both types of approaches. The experimental data obtained during the behavior analysis of the CS-CPW were used for the mathematical modeling and the design rules from the technology were applied for the boundary conditions. The design parameters estimated from the both approaches and their possible outcomes are tabulated in Table \ref{table:simulation}. Implementable physical dimensions from the estimated values were used for the corresponding EM simulations. Because of the required values of Z$_{0o}$ and Z$_{0e}$, the CS-CPW structure shown in Fig. \ref{tech_cross} was preferred in the initial design phase. A fractional line length of 110 $\mu$m was considered for the EM simulations.

It can be seen from the Table \ref{table:simulation} that the EM simulations using the design parameters obtained from the mathematical model had given better coupling coefficient. Therefore, these design parameters were used as initial values for the optimization iterations. However, EM simulations results using the values speculated from the behavioral table were also close to the design goal. The required coupling coefficient was achieved with single iteration; but the exact value of Z$_{0o}$ and Z$_{0e}$ could not be obtained. Note that this solution will sacrifice input match for coupling, as the port impedance is defined by,  $Z_{0} = \sqrt{Z_{0o}Z_{0e}}$ and that is $\sim$55 $\Omega$ . Nevertheless, we had drawn the layout of the coupler structure with these geometric parameters in the CMOS technology. However, the layout experienced metal density errors. In order to fulfill the metal density requirement, we had placed all the metal layers down to the shielding metal plane under the even-mode ground paths as shown in Fig. \ref{GCPW}. However, this modification had large impact on even-mode line parameters, as was expected (even-mode return current paths are defined to the side-ground lines). In contrast, the even-mode slow-wave effect was increased significantly which had reduced the required coupler length. Simulation data showing these effects are also included in the Table \ref{table:simulation}.

\begin{figure}

	\label{special_structure}
\end{figure}


Due to the technology specific design rules constrain, the required coupling coefficient cannot be achieved with the straight forward CS-CPW structure shown in Fig. \ref{GCPW}. Therefore, we had applied an engineering approach to obtain the design goal by introducing a special structure. While approaching to this particular structure, two things were considered. First, it was obvious that there were little room left to tune the even-mode line parameters, and second, the odd-mode slow-wave effect was less. Hence, we had modified the top most metal layer of the signal lines and created slabs for gaining strong capacitive coupling in odd-mode propagation as shown in Fig. \ref{special_structure}. The new CS-CPW structure had provided high odd-mode effective dielectric constant and significantly lowered the odd-mode impedance while the changes in even-mode parameters were less prominent. The odd- and even-mode line parameters for this modified structure are also included in the Table II. The structure was built such a way that the CS-CPW remains scalable. We had considered the structure block as a unit cell so that the complete coupler structure can be made by repeating the number of
required unit cells. In order to validate the scalability of the modified structure, we have simulated the structure with different number of unit cells and observe the effects on line parameters. It is understandable from Table III that the effect of repeating the unit cells on the line parameters are negligible hence the proposed structure is scalable.

Finally, the through port of the coupler was folded to its coupled port side for obtaining the in-phase and quadrature ports to the same side. The final geometric dimensions of the CS-CPW became \textit{W} = 2.5 $\mu$m, \textit{S} = 1.5 $\mu$m, \textit{D} = 1.54 $\mu$m (Metal 3), \textit{SG} = 19.75 $\mu$m, \textit{GW} = 5 $\mu$m. With these geometric dimensions the required metal density requirements needed for the circuit fabrication were fulfilled expect for the metal 5 and 4. Therefore, extra metal plates on these two layers were placed and they had negligible effects on the line parameters. The final simulation structure in 3D view is shown in Fig. \ref{3D_full}. The scalable line parameters obtained from the EM simulations are then used to predict the complete coupler performances and are shown in Fig. \ref{simulated_results}. From Fig. \ref{simulated_results}, it can be seen that the coupler has an insertion loss of -3.5 dB at the coupling and through ports at 90 GHz, 18 dB of isolation, a less than 4$^\circ$ phase variations and a good matching over a wide bandwidth from 55 GHz to 110 GHz. It is noteworthy to observe that the coupler is critically-coupled even though the obtained coupling coefficient (\textit{k} = 0.73) should give over-coupled performance. However, the simulation results were expected as the line loss was compensated by this extra coupling.

\section{Measurement Results}

The 3-dB quadrature coupler was fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS technology and the dimension is 56 mm $\times$ 205 mm. On-wafer \textit{S}-parameter measurements were carried out for the coupler characterization. However, the coupled line coupler is a 4-port device and due the unavailability of the 4-port VNA we had fabricated two exactly same coupler structures but with different port configurations for through and coupling measurement. For through measurement, the coupled and isolated ports were terminated to the on-chip 50 $\Omega$ resistors and the input and through ports were connected to the probing pads. On the other hand, for coupling measurement the through and isolated port were terminated with 50 $\Omega$ resistors and the input and coupled were connected to
the probing pads. In order to facilitate the connection between a coupler port and a probing pad an extra piece of SW-CPW of length 70 $\mu$m was added. The effects of the pads and the lines were de-embedded from the measurements by pad-short-open [DEumic11] and L-2L [L.2L] procedure, respectively. The micrograph of the coupler test structures are shown in Fig. \ref{micrograph}. Measured and simulated results for the coupler are shown in Fig. \ref{measurement1}. Good correlation is observed between simulations and measurements. However, slight over-coupling is observed in the measurements and
that is because of the realized odd- and even-mode impedances were different than the targeted. The measured coupler performance show an insertion loss of -3.5 dB at the through port and -4.4 dB at the coupled port at 90 GHz. A less than 2$^\circ$ phase variations, $\pm$1-dB amplitude error, and better than 18 dB return loss is measured over a wide bandwidth from 55 GHz to 110 GHz.

\end{figure}

Furthermore, too see the coupler performance without the de-embedding we had matched the
coupler and fabricated two more structures as for the other case. For the matching, we had modeled the pad and the SW-CPW through EM simulations, and terminated the isolated port with 38 $\Omega$. In this case, the length of the SW-CPW was 100 $\mu$m. The measured and simulated matched coupler performances which include the pads and connecting transmission lines are shown in Fig. \ref{measurement2}. Good agreement is again observed between measurements and simulations, especially the matching. However, the loss is bit higher than the simulation and this discrepancy may arise from the inaccurate pad modeling which is always difficult in mm-wave frequencies.

\section{Conclusion}
An algorithmic design methodology was developed for mm-wave CS-CPW based silicon couplers. Besides, an experiment on the behavior of the CS-CPW structure had performed and a design map has been created for improving the design efficiency. Based on the proposed design algorithm and the design map, a 3-dB quadrature coupler covering the whole E- to W-band has been successfully demonstrated in a 65-nm CMOS technology. The state-of-the-art results published for the 3-dB quadrature couplers realized on monolithic silicon technologies are shown in Table III. The presented results show excellent wideband coupler performances. A size reduction of about 50$\%$ compared to the conventional microstrip based quadrature couplers is achieved. Moreover, the good
agreement between the simulation and measurement results indicates the validity of the applied modeling technique. The proposed CS-CPW based coupler is well suited for the design of compact mm-wave silicon radio front-ends.
